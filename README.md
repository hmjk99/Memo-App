# Memo-App

For the overall design and structure, I got some ideas from the Notion App. 

I created 7 RESTful routes that can create, read, update, and delete data using express, node.js, and mongoose. 
I did not use any CSS frameworks to get more practice with plain CSS and used jquery for the funtionality of a modal. 
I created a modal for deleting the data so passed in the delete form in the modal. 

Overall, I did not have any difficulty with creating this CRUD app.
The app is simple and does all the functions successfully. 
In the future, I plan to update this app by adding login and user authentication.
